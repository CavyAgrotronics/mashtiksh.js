# Mashtiksh.js

**Mashtiksh.js** is a lightweight JavaScript library for creating and training neural networks using matrix operations. It provides a simple API for defining neural network architectures, performing feedforward and backpropagation, and customizing the learning process with various activation functions.

## Features

- **Matrix Operations**: Simplified matrix handling, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, transposition, and mapping.
- **Neural Network Construction**: Easy setup of neural networks with customizable layers and nodes.
- **Multiple Activation Functions**: Support for different activation functions including Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, and Softmax.
- **Backpropagation**: Automatic training with gradient descent and backpropagation.
- **Logging**: Option to log training progress and error at specified intervals.
- **Early Stopping**: Mechanism to stop training early if the error falls below a specified threshold for a defined number of consecutive iterations.

## Installation

Include the **Mashtiksh.js** library in your HTML file:
